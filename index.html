						### Administrivia
						* Bathrooms.
						* Drinks.
						* Fire exits.
						* Please interupt to ask questions.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Introduction
						* Slides: http://catalyst-training.github.io//git-basic/
						* The format of this course is mostly a tutorial
						  (with some lecturing thrown in)
						* The tutorial is based on the commandline
						* The tutorial is designed to uncover the concepts
						* Not necessarily to provide all the command syntax
						Note:
						Hopefully if you are armed with the concepts, the
						internet will help you find the specifics you need
					</section>
				</section>

				<section> <!-- Why -->
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Why use revision control software?
						You (should) want it if...

						* You want to review what you have just changed
						* You want to go back to a previous safe point
						* You want to look at how something used to be
						* You want to know why something changed
						* You are sick of keeping *.bak files
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Why use revision control software?
						You need it if...

						* You are working with other people who use it
						* You want to maintain multiple versions of the same thing
						* You need to coordinate changes accross multiple files
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### What does revision control provide?
						* Track changes (to almost anything)
						* View history
						* Look back to find when bugs were created
						* Find the reasoning behind why something is how it is
						* Roll back changes
						* Apply kudos for effort
						* Backups of your important stuff
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### What options are there?
						* RCS
						* CVS
						* Subversion
						* Darcs
						* Perforce
						* Bzr
						* ...
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Why should you use Git?
						* It is fast
						* Working with branches makes sense
						* You can do meaningful work without a network connection
						* It does not dictate your workflow
						* [It protects your data](http://git-scm.com/about/info-assurance)
						* Once you master the concepts, you can do some really creative (and useful!) stuff
						* The cool kids use it
					</section>
				</section>

				<section> <!-- Installing -->
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Installing
						```bash
						# Required
						$ sudo aptitude install git
						```
						```bash
						# Recommended
						$ sudo aptitude install gitk git-gui
						```
						```bash
						# FYI...
						$ sudo aptitude search git
						```
						Note:
						Pause here to explain the way we are showing commands

						* talk about '$' as the prompt, etc
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Installing (alternative OS)
						* Go to [git-scm.org](http://git-scm.org "The home of git")
						* Find the [Download link](http://git-scm.com/downloads "install instructions")
						* Follow the intrsuctions for your OS
						* For MS Win, you are looking for "Git BASH"
					</section>
				</section>

				<section> <!-- Init -->
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Create a new repository
						```git init```
						```bash
						$ mkdir /tmp/test
						$ cd /tmp/test
						```
						```bash
						$ git init
						Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
						```
						Check the status with ```git status```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Initial commit
						#
						nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### What did that do?
						Git is just a bit different from other revision control systems
						![overview](images/local-remote-small.png "overview")

						Note:
						The 'staging area' is often called the 'index'
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Getting help
						```bash
						# git help COMMAND
						$ git help status

						# man git-COMMAND
						$ man git-status
						```
						Note:
						The COMMANDs we have used so far are 'init' and 'status', so....
					</section>
				</section>

				<section> <!-- Configuring -->
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Global configuration settings
						Before we start...
						```bash
						# We need to tell git who you are - But it's OK to lie....
						$ git config --global user.name "Jed I. Night"
						$ git config --global user.email "null@catalyst.net.nz"
						```
						```bash
						# Choose an editor.... (this is not your IDE)
						$ git config --global core.editor gedit
						$ git config --global core.editor wordpad
						```
						```bash
						# If you will be working on windows, but need to deal with unix
						$ git config --global core.autocrlf true
						```
						Note:
						Is anyone using windows? you can't use gedit, and you don't
						want to use notepad, try:<br>
						- notepad++
						- wordpad
						- ANYTHING else!

						- but only within the current repository (which is /tmp/test)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Project configuration settings
						This will tell Git you like to see pretty colours on the screen
						```bash
						$ git config color.ui auto
						```
						Note:
						These settings will override the global settings

						- but only within the current repository (which is /tmp/test)
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Accessing the configuration settings
						Global data is stored in ```~/.gitconfig```

						Project data is stored in ```/tmp/test/.git/config```

						```bash
						# Use `git config` to see it
						$ git config -l
						```
						```bash
						# ..or just edit the files
						$ gedit ~/.gitconfig /tmp/test/.git/config
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Managing Files
						Make some changes...
						```bash
						$ touch myscript.pl
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Initial commit
						#
						# Untracked files:
						#   (use "git add &lt;file>..." to include in what will be committed)
						#
						#	myscript.pl
						nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Tell Git to track those files
						```git add```
						```bash
						$ git add myscript.pl
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Initial commit
						#
						# Changes to be committed:
						#   (use "git rm --cached &lt;file>..." to unstage)
						#
						#	new file: myscript.pl
						#
						```
						Note:
						This actually adds the file to the 'index'
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Change an existing file
						Make some changes...
						```bash
						$ echo DATA > myscript.pl
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Initial commit
						#
						# Changes to be committed:
						#   (use "git rm --cached &lt;file>..." to unstage)
						#
						#	new file:   myscript.pl
						#
						# Changed but not updated:
						#   (use "git add &lt;file>..." to update what will be committed)
						#   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
						#
						#	modified:   myscript.pl
						#
						```
						Note:
						This is our first clue that Git tracks changes rather than files
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### See what you have done
						```git diff```
						```bash
						$ git diff
						--- a/myscript.pl
						+++ b/myscript.pl
						@@ -0,0 +1 @@
						+DATA
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Change an existing file
						We need to tell Git that you intend to commit the checked out
						version, with ```git add```
						```bash
						$ git add myscript.pl
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Initial commit
						#
						# Changes to be committed:
						#   (use "git rm --cached &lt;file>..." to unstage)
						#
						#	new file:   myscript.pl
						#
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Committing changes
						Commit your work with ```git commit```
						```bash
						# You will be stuck in an editor so you can input a commit message.
						$ git commit myscript.pl
						Created commit ae54011: Add a message.
						1 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						create mode 100644 myscript.pl
						```

						Normally, you WILL make your commit message meaningful!
						Note:
						Check if everyone got a reasonable editor!

						Problems can be resolved by

						- adding to your PATH var (and restarting git bash)
						- defining an alias in your ~/.bashrc
						```bash
						  alias notepad="/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe"
						```
						- editing .gitconfig
						```bash
						[core]
						  editor = \"/C/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe\" -m
						```

					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Committing changes - some options
						You don't have to ```git add``` all your changes manually
						```bash
						# Add &lt;file>, and then commit
						$ git commit &lt;file>
						```
						```bash
						# Add all your changes, and then commit
						$ git commit -a
						```
						```bash
						# You can choose different editor for this commit...
						$ EDITOR=vim git commit -a
						```
						```bash
						# You don't have to use an editor at all...
						$ git commit -m 'commit message goes here'
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Managing Files - Permissions
						Oops, that file isn't executable
						```bash
						$ chmod 755 myscript.pl
						```
						```bash
						$ git commit myscript.pl
						Created commit 378af93: Make it executable.
						0 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						mode change 100644 => 100755 myscript.pl
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Managing Files - Move
						To rename a file use ```git mv```
						```bash
						$ git mv myscript.pl README.txt
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						# Changes to be committed:
						#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file>..." to unstage)
						#
						#	renamed: myscript.pl -> README.txt
						#
						```
						```bash
						# This has changed our checkout, and the index
						# so we are ready to commit the change
						$ git commit
						Created commit fabd446: Rename the file.
						1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						rename myscript.pl => README.txt (100%)
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Managing Files - Delete
						To delete a file use ```git rm```
						```bash
						# This won't actually work, because we haven't
						# created "another-script.pl"
						# ... but you can try it, if you like....
						$ git rm -f another-script.pl
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						# Changes to be committed:
						#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file>..." to unstage)
						#
						#	deleted: another-script.pl
						#
						```
						And commit the change
						```bash
						$ git commit
						Created commit bd10c5f: Remove another-script.pl
						0 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						delete mode 100644 another-script.pl
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Managing Files - ignore them
						```bash
						# Let's imagine your editor keeps creating '.swp' files
						$ touch README.txt.swp
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						# Untracked files:
						#   (use "git add &lt;file>..." to include in what will be committed)
						#
						#       README.txt.swp
						```
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Managing Files - ignore them
						```bash
						# Add a line that conatins '*.swp'
						$ gedit .gitignore
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						# Untracked files:
						#   (use "git add &lt;file>..." to include in what will be committed)
						#
						#       .gitignore
						```
						```bash
						# We can then commit the .gitignore file
						$ git add .gitignore
						$ git commit -m 'Created a .gitignore file'
						```
						Note:
						You can put a different .gitignore file in each directory
						...or stick to one in the root of your project
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Ignoring files Privately vs. Publicly
						* Adding things to .gitignore makes it part of your project...
						* Instead *you* can ignore things using .git/info/exclude.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Tags
						Tags allow you to mark specific points in
						history as being important.

						Often people use this functionality to mark release points.

						They work pretty much like you would expect...
						```bash
						$ git tag v1.0
						$ git tag v1.0-production -m 'this might be important later!'
						```
						```bash
						$ git tag
						$ git show v1.0
						$ git show v1.0-production
						```
						Note:
						2 types of tags: lightweight and annotated

						Tags don't get shared, by default.

						Also, explain that you can git show anything (tag, branch, sha1, etc).

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Some more concepts - commits
						* It is important to understand that git thinks in ```commits```
						* Each commit refers to a previous commit (its parent)
						* Commits can be referenced by their SHA1 checksum
							* or an abbreviation of it
							* or by a number of things that might refer to them
						* ```gitk``` lets you visualise the commit history, which

				<section> <!-- branching and merging -->
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Branching - List
						To show branches use ```git branch```
						```bash
						$ git branch
						* master
						```
						Only one branch, called ```master```

						The '*' indicates that it is your current branch
						Note:
						You can also use 'git status'
					</section>

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Branching - Create
						Use ```git branch``` (or ```git checkout -b```)
						```bash
						$ git checkout -b new-branch
						Switched to a new branch "new-branch"
						```
						Will create "new-branch", and check it out for you
						```bash
						$ git branch
						  master
						* new-branch
						```
						Note:
						mention that 'git checkout' is a convenience interface
						...it does several things in one step
					</section>

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Branching - Create somewhere else
						By default a new branch will be created at the commit you
						already have checked out

						You can also create a new branch at another commit
						```bash
						$ git checkout -b another-branch master
						Switched to a new branch "another-branch"
						```
						```bash
						$ git branch
						* another-branch
						  master
						  new-branch
						```
						Note:
						Here, the checkout command is actually doing 3 things

						- go the the master branch
						- make a branch there (callled 'another-branch')
						- checkout the 'another-branch' branch
					</section>

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Branching - Change Branch
						Use ```git checkout```
						```bash
						$ git checkout new-branch
						Switched to branch "new-branch"
						```
						```bash
						$ git branch
						  another-branch
						  master
						* new-branch
						```
						Note:
						Don't forget to see how this is shown in ```gitk```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Branching - What's the deal?
						```bash
						# Make a change to a file (and commit that change)
						$ echo "... From new-branch" >> README.txt
						$ git commit README.txt
						Created commit a6ed2cf: From new-branch
						1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						```
						```bash
						# Check the file..
						$ cat README.txt
						DATA
						... From new-branch
						```
						```bash
						# Switch to a different branch (master)
						$ git checkout master
						Switched to branch "master"
						```
						```bash
						# The text we added ain't there
						$ cat README.txt
						DATA
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Branching - Why?
						* Many (most) projects have a branch for each release
						* Branches are useful for experimental features / refactoring
						* Branches happen (without even trying) when several people try
						  to work on the same project - but I'll explain that soon ;)

						Note:
						It is useful to think of branches as an 'alternative reality'
					</section>

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Merging - Simple Case
						You should now be on the master branch
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						nothing to commit (working directory clean)
						```
						Use ```git merge```
						```bash
						$ git merge new-branch
						Updating e766bfb..a6ed2cf
						Fast forward
						README.txt |	1 +
						1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						```
						If there are no conflicts, this may make a new commit object

						but in this case, we have done a ```fast forward``` merge

						Note:
						- We are merging changes *IN*, from somewhere else
						- explain the fast forward bit
						- talk about merges being line by line, so not for binary data
						- use ```gitk``` to see what happened

					</section>

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Merging - get ready for a conflict
						Conflicts are more difficult (lets create one)
						```bash
						# Make a change to a file, commit that change to 'master'
						$ echo "New value for data" > README.txt
						$ git commit -a -m 'update script with a new value'

						# Change branches, make a change, and commit
						$ git checkout new-branch
						$ echo "different value for data" > README.txt
						$ git commit -a -m 'update script with a different value'

						# Go back to the master branch, if we try to merge - there
						# will be a problem!
						$ git checkout master
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Merging - you can't do that
						If there is a conflict then git will stop and make you fix it.
						```bash
						$ git merge new-branch
						Auto-merged README.txt
						CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.txt
						Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						# Unmerged paths:
						#   (use "git add/rm &lt;file>..." as appropriate to mark resolution)
						#
						#	   both modified:	  README.txt
						#
						no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
						```
						```bash
						$ cat README.txt
						<<<<<<< HEAD:README.txt
						New value for data
						=======
						different value for data
						>>>>>>> new-branch:README.txt
						```
						Note:
						  Mention git merge --abort

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Merging - Fixing conflicts
						Lots of tools to help fix things up.  Hand edit, xxdiff,
						smartmerge, etc

						We'll just fix it by editing the file
						```bash
						$ gedit README.txt
						$ cat README.txt
						New, different value for data
						```
						But Git still won't allow us to continue...
						```bash
						$ git commit
						U	README.txt
						fatal: 'commit' is not possible because you have unmerged files.
						Please, fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm &lt;file>' as
						appropriate to mark resolution and make a commit, or use 'git commit -a'.
						```
					</section>

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Merging - Success at last
						We need to tell Git that it has been fixed before we commit
						```bash
						$ git add README.txt
						$ git commit
						Created commit a411f2a: Merge branch 'new-branch'
						```
						In this case the commit message is automatically created, but
						you can edit it if you want.
						```bash
						Merge branch 'new-branch'

						Conflicts:

							README.txt

						### Creating Repositories - Revisited
						We already know how to create a new repositry

					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Clone an existing repository
						In practise, you're more likely to use ```git clone```.

						To check out the source code of a random project:
						```bash
						$ cd /tmp
						```
						```bash
						$ git clone https://github.com/catalyst-training/git-basic
						Cloning into git-basic...
						remote: Counting objects: 90, done.
						remote: Compressing objects: 100% (43/43), done.
						remote: Total 90 (delta 44), reused 90 (delta 44)
						Receiving objects: 100% (90/90), 31.62 KiB, done.
						Resolving deltas: 100% (44/44), done.

						### Terminology: Remote branches
						Remote branches are references (pointers) to the state of
						branches in your remote repositories.

						They're local branches
						that you can't move; they're moved automatically for you
						whenever you do any network communication.

						Remote branches act
						as bookmarks to remind you where the branches on your remote
						repositories were the last time you connected to them.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Terminology: Origin
						You can see all branches (including the remote ones) with the
						```git branch``` command
						```bash
						$ cd /tmp/git-basic/
						$ git branch -a
						* master
						  remotes/origin/master
						```
						Note:
						you don't need to type 'remotes' to refer to these branches
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Other remotes
						You can manipulate your view of other repositories with the ```git remote```
						command
						```bash
						$ git remote add duplicate https://github.com/catalyst-training/git-basic
						$ git remote show
						duplicate
						origin
						```
						```bash
						$ git fetch --all
						Fetching origin
						Fetching duplicate
						From https://github.com/catalyst-training/git-basic
						 * [new branch]      gh-pages   -> duplicate/gh-pages
						 * [new branch]      master     -> duplicate/master
						```
						Note:
						origin is not special, except that:

						- it is created by default when you clone a repository
						- some commands (like fetch) assume you mean origin if you don't specify the remote
						- etc, etc

						### Now we can try it out
						```bash
						# Clone a new repository
						$ cd /tmp
						$ git clone https://github.com/git-training-open/alice1.git
						$ cd /tmp/alice1
						```
						```bash
						# Create a new file (and commit)

				</section>

				<section> <!-- Stuff we have missed ... -->
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Changing your commits
						You can 'change' the most recent commit using ```git commit```
						```bash
						$ git add something.txt
						$ git commit --amend
						```
						This is quite a big deal...
						Note:
						Will someone please pull me up on this?!

						Explain how this works

						- That you are not changing anything here
						- just making a new commit which is quite like the old one
						- and then moving the labels around

						Warning:

						- Do not change commits that exist outside your repository.
						- If you do, people will hate you, and you'll be scorned
						  by friends and family.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Copy a commit
						You can copy a commit from one branch to another

						You might want to do this if, for example, a bug is discovered
						on your development branch that also needs to be applied to your
						production branch.
						```bash
						$ git cherry-pick e43a6fd3e94888d76779ad79fb568ed180e5fcdf
						```
						Note:
						The commit created will look the same, but have a
						different commit id

						Note that the cherry-pick can fail, if there are conflicts
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Undo a commit
						You can undo a previous commit with ```git revert```.

						This makes a new commit, that is the exact opposite of a
						previous commit in your repository.

						The previous commit remains intact.
						```bash
						$ git revert e43a6fd3e94888d76779ad79fb568ed180e5fcdf
						```
						```bash
						$ git log --pretty=oneline
						830d77273fc24c0708403102a05a5a5ffecfce93 Revert "Introduce bug"
						d7a1ee454168081227ee82c5f11bb08f77e2643d Unrelated change
						e43a6fd3e94888d76779ad79fb568ed180e5fcdf Introduce bug
						```
						Note:
						When you revert the commit, you get dropped into an editor
						in case you want to can edit the commit message..
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Getting serious with copying commits
						As an alternative to merging, you can use ```git rebase```.

						Instead of making a new commit which joins two branches together,
						it copies your changes on top of the other branch...

						You use it just like a merge.
						```bash
						$ git rebase origin/master
						```
						Note:
						Draw what this does, contrast it with a merge
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Rebase vs. Merge
						> One point of view on this is that your repository's commit
						> history is a record of what actually happened. It's a historical
						> document, valuable in its own right, and shouldn't be tampered
						> with. From this angle, changing the commit history is almost
						> blasphemous; you're lying about what actually transpired. So
						> what if there was a messy series of merge commits? That's how
						> it happened, and the repository should preserve that for
						> posterity.

						Note:
						History is an audit trail
					</section>
					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Rebase vs. Merge
						> The opposing point of view is that the commit history is the
						> story of how your project was made. You wouldn't publish the
						> first draft of a book, and the manual for how to maintain your

						> tools like rebase and filter-branch to tell the story in the
						> way that's best for future readers.
						Note:
						History is a story

						pick 180e665 Release engineering (0.8)

						# Rebase aa8a695..e1fac16 onto aa8a695
						#
						# Commands:
						#  p, pick = use commit
						#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
						#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
						#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
						#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
						#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
						#
						# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
						#
						# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
						# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.

						### Problem 6
						####	Abort a merge
						Go to your 'example2' project, and try to merge in the 'kittens'
						branch...
						```bash
						# Create a conflict
						$ cd /tmp/example2
						$ git merge origin/kittens
						$ git status
						```
						Oh, no, there are conflicts!  Get me out of here!
						Note:
						or a rebase ...

						### Problem 6
						####	Solution
						```bash
						# Too hard, I'll try again some other time
						$ git merge --abort

						### Problem 6b
						#### Use tools to try to resolve a conflict
						Go to your 'example2' project, and try to merge in the 'kittens'
						branch...
						```bash
						# Create a conflict
						$ cd /tmp/example2
						$ git merge origin/kittens
						$ git status
						```
						There are conflicts, but I think you can handle them!

						### Problem 6b
						####	Solution
						```bash
						# Let's give it a go...
						$ git mergetool

						Note:
						Also, we should try this again after installing 'meld'

						### Problem 7
						#### Throw away your changes
						What if you make some changes, and you want to get back to safety?
						```bash
						$ cd /tmp/example2
						$ echo 'A dragon will fix it' > lists/links.txt
						$ rm lists/movies.txt
						$ git status
						```

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
						### Problem 7
						#### Solution
						```bash
						$ git reset --hard
						```
						Note:
						Could we use git-reset? git-checkout? gitk? git-clean?

						###  The End
						#### That's really it this time
						Note:
						Extra things to discuss, to fill in time:
						- Setting up a bare repo
						- git add/commit -p
						- git bisect
						- git reflog
