						## Introduction
						* The format of this course is mostly a tutorial
						  (with some lecturing thrown in)
						* The tutorial uses a linux command line, but git
						  is available on other platforms
						* The tutorial is designed to uncover the concepts
						* Not necessarily to provide all the command syntax
						 * Hopefully if you are armed with the concepts, the
						   internet will help you find the specifics you need
					</div>
					</section>

				<section> <!-- Why -->
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Why use revision control software?
						#### You (should) want it if...
						* You are sick of keeping *.bak files
						* You want to look at how something used to be
						* You want to know why something changed
						* You want to review what you have just changed
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Why use revision control software?
						#### You need it if...
						* You are working with other people who use it
						* You want to maintain multiple versions of the same thing
						* You need to make a single change which covers several files - and keep things in sync
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## What does revision control provide?
						* Track changes (to almost anything)
						* View history
						* Look back to find when bugs were created
						* Find the reasoning behind why something is how it is
						* Roll back changes
						* Apply kudos for effort
						* Backups of your important stuff
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## What options are there?
						* RCS
						* CVS
						* Subversion
						* Darcs
						* Perforce
						* Bzr
						* ...
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Why should you use Git?
						* It is fast
						* Branching is trivial
						* Merging of branches actually makes sense
						* You can be disconnected from the network, yet still continue working
						* It does not dictate your workflow
						* [It protects your data](http://git-scm.com/about/info-assurance)
						* Once you master the concepts, you can do some really creative (and useful!) stuff
						* The cool kids use it

					<div data-markdown>
						## Installing
						```bash
						# Required
						$ sudo aptitude install git
						```
						```bash
						# Recommended
						$ sudo aptitude install gitk git-gui
						```
						```bash
						# FYI...
						$ sudo aptitude search git
						```
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Pause here to explain the way we are showing commands
							- talk about '$' as the prompt, etc

					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Installing (alternative OS)
						* Go to [git-scm.org](http://git-scm.org "The home of git") 
						* Find the [Download link](http://git-scm.com/downloads "install instructions")
						* Follow the intrsuctions for your OS
						* For MS Win, you are looking for "Git BASH"

				<section> <!-- Init -->
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Create a new repository
						```git init```
						```bash
						$ mkdir /tmp/test
						```
						```bash
						$ cd /tmp/test
						```
						```bash
						$ git init
						Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
						```
						Check the status with ```git status```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Initial commit
						#
						nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
						```

        <section> <!-- Configuring -->
          <section>
          <div data-markdown>
            ## Global configuration settings
            Before we start, we need to tell git who you are
            ```bash
            # But it's OK to lie....
            $ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
            $ git config --global user.email "null@catalyst.net.nz"
            ```
            ```bash
            # If you think nano``` is crap, you can choose vim, or gedit
            $ git config --global core.editor gedit
            ```
          </div>
          </section>
          <section>
          <div data-markdown>
            ## Project configuration settings
            This will tell Git you like to see pretty colours on the screen
            ```bash
            $ git config color.ui auto
            $ git config --global log.decorate full
            ```
          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            These settings will override the global settings

            - but only within the current repository (which is /tmp/test)
          </aside>
          </section>
          <section>
          <div data-markdown>
            ## Accessing the configuration settings
            Global data is stored in ```$HOME/.gitconfig```

            Project data is stored in ```$PROJECT/.git/config```

            Use ```git config``` to see it
            ```bash
            $ git config -l
            ```
            ..or just edit the files
            ```bash
            $ gedit ~/.gitconfig /tmp/test/.git/config
            ```

						## Managing Files
						Make some changes...
						```bash
						$ touch super-script.pl
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Initial commit
						#
						# Untracked files:
						#   (use "git add &lt;file>..." to include in what will be committed)
						#
						#	super-script.pl
						nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
						```
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Tell Git to track those files
						```git add```
						```bash
						$ git add super-script.pl 
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Initial commit
						#
						# Changes to be committed:
						#   (use "git rm --cached &lt;file>..." to unstage)
						#
						#	new file: super-script.pl
						#
						```
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						This actually adds the file to the 'index'
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Change an existing file
						Make some changes...
						```bash
						$ echo DATA > super-script.pl
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Initial commit
						#
						# Changes to be committed:
						#   (use "git rm --cached &lt;file>..." to unstage)
						#
						#	new file:   super-script.pl
						#
						# Changed but not updated:
						#   (use "git add &lt;file>..." to update what will be committed)
						#   (use "git checkout -- &lt;file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
						#
						#	modified:   super-script.pl
						#
						```
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## See what you have done
						```git diff```
						```bash
						$ git diff
						--- a/super-script.pl
						+++ b/super-script.pl
						@@ -0,0 +1 @@
						+DATA
						```
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Change an existing file
						We need to tell Git that you intend to commit the checked out
						version, with ```git add```
						```bash
						$ git add super-script.pl 
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Initial commit
						#
						# Changes to be committed:
						#   (use "git rm --cached &lt;file>..." to unstage)
						#
						#	new file:   super-script.pl
						#
						```
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Committing changes
						Commit your work with ```git commit```
						```bash
						$ git commit super-script.pl 
						Created commit ae54011: Add a message.
						1 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						create mode 100644 super-script.pl
						```
						You will be stuck in an editor so you can input a commit message
						Normally, you WILL make your commit message meaningful!
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						We have told git about our changes, but
						we haven't actually committed anything yet.<br>

						This is deliberate - so you can build up more complex commits.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Committing changes - some options
						You don't have to ```git add``` all your changes manually
						```bash
						# Add <file>, and then commit
						$ git commit <file>
						```
						```bash
						# Add all your changes, and then commit
						$ git commit -a
						```
						You can have an easier editor...
						```bash
						$ EDITOR=gedit git commit -a
						```
						You don't have to use an editor at all...
						```bash
						$ git commit -m 'commit message goes here'
						```
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Managing Files - Permissions
						Oops, that file isn't executable
						```bash
						$ chmod 755 super-script.pl 
						```
						```bash
						$ git commit super-script.pl 
						Created commit 378af93: Make it executable.
						0 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						mode change 100644 => 100755 super-script.pl
						```
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Managing Files - Move
						To rename a file use ```git mv```
						```bash
						$ git mv super-script.pl silly-script.pl
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						# Changes to be committed:
						#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file>..." to unstage)
						#
						#	renamed: super-script.pl -> silly-script.pl
						#
						```
						This has changed our checkout, and the index, so we are ready to
						commit the change
						```bash
						$ git commit
						Created commit fabd446: Rename the file.
						1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						rename super-script.pl => silly-script.pl (100%)
						```
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Managing Files - Delete
						To delete a file use ```git rm```
						```bash
						# This won't actually work, because we haven't
						# created "another-script.pl"
						# ... but you can try it, if you like....
						$ git rm -f another-script.pl 
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						# Changes to be committed:
						#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file>..." to unstage)
						#
						#	deleted: another-script.pl
						#
						```
						<li>And commit the change</li>
						```bash
						$ git commit
						Created commit bd10c5f: Remove another-script.pl
						0 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						delete mode 100644 another-script.pl
						```
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Managing Files - ignore them
						```bash
						# Let's imagine your editor keeps creating '.swp' files
						$ touch silly-script.pl.bak
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						# Untracked files:
						#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
						#
						#       silly-script.pl.bak
						```
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Managing Files - ignore them
						```bash
						# Add a line that conatins '*.swp'
						$ gedit .gitignore
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						# Untracked files:
						#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
						#
						#       .gitignore
						```
						```bash
						# We can then commit the .gitignore file
						$ git add .gitignore
						$ git commit -m 'Created a .gitignore file'
						```
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						You can put a different .gitignore file in each directory<br>
						...or stick to one in the root of your project<br>
						</aside>
					</section>
          <section>
          <div data-markdown>
            ## Ignoring files Locally vs. Globally
            * Adding things to .gitignore will ignore them for all users!
            * Instead you can ignore things locally using .git/info/exclude.
          </div>
            <aside class="notes">

          </section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Tags
						Tags work pretty much like you would expect.
						They allow you to mark specific points in
						history as being important.

						Often people use this functionality to mark release points.
						```bash
						$ git tag v1.0
						$ git tag v1.0-production -m 'this might be important later!'
						```
						```bash
						$ git tag
						$ git show v1.0
						$ git show v1.0-production
						```
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						2 types of tags: lightweight and annotated<br>
						Tags don't get shared, by default.<br>
						<br>
						Also, explain that you can git show anything (tag, branch, sha1, etc).<br>

						## Change Logs
						You can also specify a file or directory
						```bash
						$ git log silly-script.pl 
						```
					</div>
					</section>

					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Change Logs - Annotate
						Show who made changes to what line
						```bash

				<section> <!-- Concepts 2 ... -->
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Some more concepts - commits
						* It is important to understand that git thinks in ```commits```
						* Each commit refers to a previous commit (its parent)
						* Commits can be referenced by their SHA1 checksum
							* or an abbreviation of it
							* or by a number of things that might refer to them
						* ```gitk``` lets you visualise the commit history, which
							helps a lot

				<section> <!-- branching and merging -->
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Branching - List
						To show branches use ```git branch```
						```bash
						$ git branch
						* master
						```
						Only one branch, called ```master```

						The '*' indicates that it is your current branch
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							You can also use 'git status'
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						 ## Branching - Create
						Use ```git branch``` (or ```git checkout -b```)
						```bash
						$ git checkout -b new-branch
						Switched to a new branch "new-branch"
						```
						Will create "new-branch", and check it out for you
						```bash
						$ git branch
						  master
						* new-branch
						```
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						mention that 'git checkout' is a convenience interface
						...it does several things in one step
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Branching - Create somewhere else
						By default a new branch will be created at the commit you
						already have checked out

						You can also create a new branch at another commit
						```bash
						$ git checkout -b another-branch master
						Switched to a new branch "another-branch"
						```
						```bash
						$ git branch
						* another-branch
						  master
						  new-branch
						```
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						Here, the checkout command is actually doing 3 things<br>
						- go the the master branch<br>
						- make a branch there (callled 'another-branch')<br>
						- checkout the 'another-branch' branch
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Branching - Change Branch
						Use ```git checkout```
						```bash
						$ git checkout new-branch
						Switched to branch "new-branch"
						```
						```bash
						$ git branch
						  another-branch
						  master
						* new-branch
						```
						Don't forget to see how this is shown in ```gitk```
					</div>
					</section>

					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Branching - What's the deal?
						```bash
						# Make a change to a file (and commit that change)
						$ echo "... From new-branch" >> silly-script.pl 
						$ git commit silly-script.pl 
						Created commit a6ed2cf: From new-branch
						1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						```
						```bash
						# Check the file..
						$ cat silly-script.pl 
						DATA
						... From new-branch
						```
						```bash
						# Jump to another branch
						$ git checkout master
						Switched to branch "master"
						```
						```bash
						# The text we added ain't there
						$ cat silly-script.pl 
						DATA
						```
					</div>
					</section>

					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Branching - Why?
						* Many (most) projects have a branch for each release
						* Branches are useful for experimental features / refactoring
						* Branches happen (without even trying) when several people try
						  to work on the same project - but I'll explain that soon ;)

						## Merging - Simple Case
						You should now be on the master branch
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						nothing to commit (working directory clean)
						```
						Use ```git merge```
						```bash
						$ git merge new-branch
						Updating e766bfb..a6ed2cf
						Fast forward
						silly-script.pl |	1 +
						1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
						```
						In this case, we have done a ```fast forward``` merge

						If there are no conflicts, this may make a new commit object

						use ```gitk``` to see what happened
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						* We are merging changes *IN*, from somewhere else<br>
						* explain the fast forward bit<br>
						* talk about merges being line by line, so not for binary data
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Merging - get ready for a conflict
						Conflicts are more difficult (lets create one)
						```bash
						# Make a change to a file, commit that change to 'master'
						$ echo "New value for data" > silly-script.pl
						$ git commit -a -m 'update script with a new value'

						# Change branches, make a change, and commit
						$ git checkout new-branch
						$ echo "different value for data" > silly-script.pl
						$ git commit -a -m 'update script with a different value'

						# Go back to the master branch, if we try to merge - there
						# will be a problem!
						$ git checkout master
						```
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Sorry about the wall of text!
						Also, explain the fast forward bit
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Merging - you can't do that
						If there is a conflict then git will stop and make you fix it.
						```bash
						$ git merge new-branch
						Auto-merged silly-script.pl
						CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in silly-script.pl
						Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
						```
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						# Unmerged paths:
						#   (use "git add/rm &lt;file>..." as appropriate to mark resolution)
						#
						#	   both modified:	  silly-script.pl
						#
						no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
						```
						```bash
						$ cat silly-script.pl 
						&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:silly-script.pl
						New value for data
						=======
						different value for data
						>>>>>>> new-branch:silly-script.pl
						```
					</div>
					</section>

					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Merging - Fixing conflicts
						Lots of tools to help fix things up.  Hand edit, xxdiff,
						smartmerge, etc

						We'll just fix it by editing the file
						```bash
						$ gedit silly-script.pl 
						$ cat silly-script.pl 
						New, different value for data
						```
						But Git still won't allow us to continue...
						```bash
						$ git commit
						U	silly-script.pl
						fatal: 'commit' is not possible because you have unmerged files.
						Please, fix them up in the work tree, and then use 'git add/rm &lt;file>' as
						appropriate to mark resolution and make a commit, or use 'git commit -a'.
						```
					</div>
					</section>

					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Merging - Success at last
						We need to tell Git that it has been fixed before we commit
						```bash
						$ git add silly-script.pl 
						$ git commit
						Created commit a411f2a: Merge branch 'new-branch'
						```
						In this case the commit message is automatically created, but
						you can edit it if you want.
						```bash
						Merge branch 'new-branch'

						Conflicts:

							silly-script.pl
						```

						## Creating Repositories - Revisited
						We already know how to create a new repositry
						```bash
						$ git init
						Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
						```
						...but normally, you want to join in with an existing project
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Clone an existing repository
						In practise, you're more likely to use ```git clone```.

						To check out the source code of a random project:
						```bash
						$ cd /tmp
						```
						```bash
						$ git clone https://github.com/catalyst-training/git-basic
						Cloning into git-basic...
						remote: Counting objects: 90, done.
						remote: Compressing objects: 100% (43/43), done.
						remote: Total 90 (delta 44), reused 90 (delta 44)
						Receiving objects: 100% (90/90), 31.62 KiB, done.
						Resolving deltas: 100% (44/44), done.
						```
						```bash
						$ cd git-basic
						```
						```bash
						$ ls 
						```
						```bash
						$ gitk 
						```

						## Remote repositories - URLs
						```bash
						# Clone an existing repository via HTTP
						$ git clone http://git.catalyst.net.nz/git.git
						```
						```bash
						# Clone an existing repository via SSH
						$ git clone ssh://git.catalyst.net.nz/git/public/git.git

						```bash
						# Clone an existing local repository (this is just a bit mad)
						$ git clone test test2
						```
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Remote branches
						Remote branches are references (pointers) to the state of
						branches in your remote repositories.

						They're local branches
						that you can't move; they're moved automatically for you
						whenever you do any network communication.

						Remote branches act
						as bookmarks to remind you where the branches on your remote
						repositories were the last time you connected to them.
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Origin
						You can see all branches (including the remote ones) with the
						```git branch``` command
						```bash
						$ cd /tmp/git-basic/
						$ git branch -a
						* master
						  remotes/origin/master
						```
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						origin is not special<br>
						you don't need to type 'remotes' to refer to these branches

						<aside class="notes">
						Will someone please pull me up on this?!<br>
						Explain how this works<br>
						- That you are not changing anything here<br>
						- just making a new commit which is quite like the old one<br>
						- and then moving the labels around<br>
						Warning:<br>
						- Do not change commits that exist outside your repository.<br>
						- If you do, people will hate you, and you'll be scorned
						  by friends and family.<br>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Copy a commit
						You can copy a commit from one branch to another

						You might want to do this if, for example, a bug is discovered
						on your development branch that also needs to be applied to you 
						production branch.
						```bash
						$ git cherry-pick e43a6fd3e94888d76779ad79fb568ed180e5fcdf
						```
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						Note that the commit created will look the same, but have a
						different commit id<br>
						Note that the cherry-pick can fail, if there are conflicts<br>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Undo a commit
						You can undo a previous commit with ```git revert```.

						This makes a new commit, that is the exact opposite of a
						previous commit in your repository.

						The previous commit remains intact.
						```bash
						$ git revert e43a6fd3e94888d76779ad79fb568ed180e5fcdf
						```
						```bash
						$ git log --pretty=oneline
						830d77273fc24c0708403102a05a5a5ffecfce93 Revert "Introduce bug"
						d7a1ee454168081227ee82c5f11bb08f77e2643d Unrelated change
						e43a6fd3e94888d76779ad79fb568ed180e5fcdf Introduce bug
						```
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						When you revert the commit, you get dropped into an editor
						in case you want to can edit the commit message..<br>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Getting serious with copying commits
						As an alternative to merging, you can use ```git rebase```.

						Instead of making a new commit which joins two branches together,
						it copies your changes on top of the other branch...

						You use it just like a merge.
						```bash
						$ git rebase origin/master
						```
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						Draw what this does, contrast it with a merge<br>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Rebase vs. Merge
						### History is an audit trail

						One point of view on this is that your repository's commit
						history is a record of what actually happened. It's a historical
					    document, valuable in its own right, and shouldn't be tampered
						with. From this angle, changing the commit history is almost
						blasphemous; you're lying about what actually transpired. So
						what if there was a messy series of merge commits? That's how
						it happened, and the repository should preserve that for
						posterity.
					</div>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## Rebase vs. Merge
						### History is a story

						The opposing point of view is that the commit history is the
						story of how your project was made. You wouldn't publish the
						first draft of a book, and the manual for how to maintain your
						software deserves careful editing. This is the camp that uses
						tools like rebase and filter-branch to tell the story in the
						way that's best for future readers.
					</div>
						<aside class="notes">
						Repeat:<br>
						You should not change commits that have been shared with others
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
					<div data-markdown>
						## A more advanced rebase
						```bash
						$ git rebase --interactive origin/master
						```
						```bash
						pick a3895fe Try a bit harder to return a useful value from all methods
						pick 180e665 Release engineering (0.8)
						pick 2a6d832 Update Build.PL for newer build tools
						pick e1fac16 Use semantic versioning (http://semver.org/)

						# Rebase aa8a695..e1fac16 onto aa8a695
						#
						# Commands:
						#  p, pick = use commit
						#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
						#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
						#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
						#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
						#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
						#
						# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
						#
						# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
						# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.

						## Loose ends...
						### git reset
						In it's simplest form, it allows you to throw away changes
						you have made locally.
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						# Changes not staged for commit:
						#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
						#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
						#
						#       modified:   index.html
						```
						```bash
						$ git reset --hard
						HEAD is now at 5cc4a26 wr235825: small changes
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						nothing to commit (working directory clean)
						```

						### git reset
						```bash
						# You can also change to a different commit before doing
						# the reset
						$ git reset --hard HEAD^^
						HEAD is now at a51452d rewrite the 'begin' function
						```
					</div>
					<div data-markdown class="fragment">
						```bash
						# This changes your commit, but leaves your files and index untouched
						# - changes that you have 'added' are still ready to commit
						# - changes to files are still ready to add

					</div>
					<div data-markdown class="fragment">

						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						#
						#	modified:   super-script.pl

						$ git stash
						Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: 5cc4a26 added a file

						### git stash (restore)
						Later on, you can restore your changes
						```bash
						$ git status
						# On branch master
						nothing to commit (working directory clean)

						$ git stash pop
						# On branch master
						#
						# Changes not staged for commit:
						#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
						#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
						#
						#       modified:   super-script.pl
						no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
